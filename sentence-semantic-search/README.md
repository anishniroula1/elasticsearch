# Semantic sentence search

This API saves sentences in OpenSearch and uses Amazon Titan vectors to find
sentences with the same or similar meaning.

The project currently uses OpenSearch only. There is no PostgreSQL connection,
table, background matching job, or saved match list. This makes seeding much
simpler and faster. Matches are calculated when a search endpoint is called.

If saved matching lists and saved application totals are needed later, read
[POSTGRES_MATCHING_RESTORE_GUIDE.md](POSTGRES_MATCHING_RESTORE_GUIDE.md). That
file contains the table design, matching rules, and a ready-to-use prompt for
adding the database flow back.

## What is stored

The project creates two OpenSearch indexes.

### Sentence occurrences

Index: sentence_occurrences-v1  
Alias: sentence_occurrences

This index stores every sentence occurrence. It contains the application,
document, section, global ID, sentence text, flags, analysis group, and
sentenceKey.

globalId is stored as an OpenSearch long, so its value must be numeric. The
internal OpenSearch document _id is the string form of that same number. Values
with letters are rejected, and leading zeros are not preserved.

The sentenceKey is a SHA-256 value made from normalized sentence text. The same
sentence text always gets the same key.

### Semantic catalog

Index: sentence_semantic_catalog-ivf-v1
Alias: sentence_semantic_catalog

This index stores one record for each unique sentenceKey. It contains the
sentence text and its 512-dimension Titan vector. The vector uses FAISS with
cosine similarity and the trained IVF model configured by
OPENSEARCH_IVF_MODEL_ID.

Titan creates the embedding. The IVF model does not create embeddings; it
organizes existing embeddings into buckets. The search uses radial min_score
with OPENSEARCH_IVF_NPROBES, so no fixed top-K limit is used.

If the same sentence appears in many documents, its vector is created only
once. All occurrence records use the same sentenceKey.

## Seeding flow

1. Read the CSV from top to bottom. The file is not sorted.
2. Validate every sentence and create its sentenceKey.
3. Check which sentence keys already exist in the catalog.
4. Send only new catalog records through the OpenSearch ingest pipeline. The
   pipeline calls Titan and creates the 512-dimension vector.
5. Save the occurrence records after their catalog batch succeeds.
6. Refresh both indexes once per worker wave.

The seed flow does not search for matches. It does not build summaries. The
SEED_WORKERS setting controls how many catalog batches can call the ingest
pipeline at the same time.

Input CSV columns:

```text
applicationId,tspId,sectionName,globalId,sentIdLocal,sentenceContent,isTracer,isFormLanguage,sentenceKey,sourceType,createdAt,updatedAt,analysisGroup
```

sentenceKey, createdAt, and updatedAt may be empty. The API creates the key and
fills missing dates. globalId must contain a number that fits in an OpenSearch
signed 64-bit long.

## Search flow

Tracer and form-language sentences still get vectors and occurrence records.
They are left out of semantic matching results.

The default analysis group is Asylee. The caller can send another analysis
group. The caller can also send any threshold from 1 through 100.

### Search by sentence key

```text
GET /applications/A1/sentences/semantic-search
    ?sentenceKey=<64-character SHA-256 key>
    &analysisGroup=Asylee
    &threshold=90
```

The API:

1. Reads the saved vector for sentenceKey.
2. Runs a live vector search in the catalog.
3. Keeps catalog results at or above the requested cosine percentage.
4. Reads matching occurrences outside the provided application.
5. Returns every result with matchType exact or similar and matchPercentage.

No Titan call is made during this search because the vector already exists.
For IVF, the API searches the number of closest buckets configured by
OPENSEARCH_IVF_NPROBES. A larger value improves recall but adds search work.

### Application summary

```text
GET /applications/A1/sentences/semantic-summary
    ?analysisGroup=Asylee
    &threshold=90
    &pageSize=100
```

The first request searches every unique eligible sentence key in the
application. This is needed to return the complete totalMatching and
sectionMatches values. The response token carries those totals to later pages,
so later pages only calculate matches for that page.

Because totals are no longer saved in a database, the first summary request can
take longer for applications with many unique sentences. This is the expected
tradeoff for faster seeding and no database.

Use nextToken exactly as returned:

```text
GET /applications/A1/sentences/semantic-summary
    ?analysisGroup=Asylee
    &threshold=90
    &pageSize=100
    &nextToken=<returned token>
```

## Other endpoints

```text
GET    /health
GET    /stats
GET    /index-documents?index=sentence_occurrences&count=10
GET    /index-documents?index=sentence_semantic_catalog&count=10
POST   /admin/init
POST   /admin/seed?reset=false&csvPath=data/seed.csv
POST   /sentences
DELETE /applications/{applicationId}?confirm=true
DELETE /documents/{tspId}?applicationId=A1&confirm=true
DELETE /admin/storage?confirm=true
```

The catalog preview includes the decoded embedding list. Deleting an
application or document also deletes catalog vectors that are no longer used by
any occurrence.

## Environment setup

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the AWS and OpenSearch values.

Important values:

```text
OPENSEARCH_HOST=search-your-domain.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com
OPENSEARCH_SEMANTIC_MODEL_ID=<deployed OpenSearch model ID>
OPENSEARCH_IVF_MODEL_ID=<created OpenSearch k-NN IVF model ID>
OPENSEARCH_IVF_NPROBES=64
OPENSEARCH_INGEST_PIPELINE=sentence_bedrock_embedding_pipeline
OPENSEARCH_CATALOG_INDEX=sentence_semantic_catalog-ivf-v1
VECTOR_DIMENSION=512
SEED_BATCH_SIZE=100
SEED_WORKERS=4
MATCH_THRESHOLD=90
```

The deployed Titan model, ingest pipeline, trained IVF model, and catalog must
all use dimension 512. A different dimension causes index creation or indexing
to fail.

For the complete training, reindexing, validation, alias switch, and rollback
steps, read [IVF_CATALOG_MIGRATION.md](IVF_CATALOG_MIGRATION.md).

## Run the API

Run in Docker:

```bash
make dev
```

Swagger opens at:

```text
http://localhost:8008/docs
```

Run locally:

```bash
make local
```

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

## Reset warning

Sending reset=true to the seed endpoint deletes and recreates the project
indexes before loading the CSV. It also removes an old catalog currently behind
the project alias. Sending reset=false keeps existing data and creates only
missing catalog vectors.

If the occurrence index was created when globalId used the keyword mapping,
recreate it before loading numeric IDs. OpenSearch cannot change an existing
field from keyword to long in place.

The admin storage delete endpoint removes both indexes and aliases. It requires
confirm=true.
